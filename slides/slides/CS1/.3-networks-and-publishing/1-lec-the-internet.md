# Path of a Web Request

## I want to go to `https://dash.canora.us`

* `https://dash.canora.us` is a URL.
* `https` is a **protocol**
* `.us` is a **top-level domain**
* `canora` is a **domain**
* `dash` is a **subdomain**

## What's its address?

* In order to go to a URL, we need the IP address of the server it runs on
  * An IP address looks like this: 5.9.22.156
* We can turn a domain into an IP address using DNS, or the Domain Name Service

## How do we start our journey?

* We connect to a device called a "switch". 
* The switch takes our request, and sends it one "hop" closer

---

## How do I get closer?

* Switches keep sending us to switches closer to our destination
