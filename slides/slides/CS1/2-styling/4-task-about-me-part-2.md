# "About Me" Site

# (part 2)

----

## Background
You made an about-me website, and your content looks great.

Now, we're going to use CSS to make it pretty!

----

## Your Task
Add CSS styles to your "About Me" site. 

You should use, at minimum:
* `background-color` to control the background color of an element (*hint: try adding it to the `body` tag!*)
* `color` to control the color of text
* `text-align` to control the position of text
* `height` and `width` to control the size of an element (*hint: this is super useful for `image` elements*)

Make your website consistent, attractive, and *not ugly*
