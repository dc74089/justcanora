# "About Me" Site

# (part 1)

----

## Background

So far in this course, you have put together single webpages. 

Remember, a website is a *"collection of web pages and related content"*.

It's time to make your first website!

----

## Your task

For our first big site, you will be making a **personal homepage**. 

Right now, you're going to start with the *content*, and we will revisit this site and add some *styling*

&nbsp;

(That means it's going to be pretty ugly right now... Trust the process!)

* When I ask for a list, please give me a *real HTML list*.
    * Look at the lecture slides, our HTML reference, or ask if you need a reminder!
* Use the HTML and body tags, headings, paragraphs, etc. appropriately.
    * For this whole course, even if I do not specifically ask for them, you need them.
* Check your code for silly mistakes or red squigglies, and make something you're proud of.
