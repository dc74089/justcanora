# Why CS

<div style="text-align: center">

</div>

Note:
One of my favorite series as a kid was So You Want to Be a Wizard. In the books, two kids (Kit and Nita)
are inducted as wizards. 

Magic in these books is done by mastery of The Speech. The Speech is a language that the universe speaks.
Everything, from trees to rocks to the air can speak and listen in The Speech. To cast a spell, a wizard
uses The Speech to speak their objective, and suggest a way of making it happen. Magically, it happens. 

I see programming as the same type of wizardry as the kids in these books. Just like wizards are scholars
of The Speech, programmers are scholars of these "magical" languages where, in order to bring something
into existence, all you have to do is speak it.
