## Communication

Human communication is the sum total of many different components of communication. 

Can generally be split into three categories:
* Verbal
* Paraverbal
* Nonverbal

# Verbal Communication

---

## Terms

* Word: a single meaningful element of language that is able to hold meaning on its own
* Denotation: the literal definition of a word
* Connotation: the implied "vibe" of a word

Note: 
We all should know what a word is. 

For denotation, think "dictionary".

Connotation is completely vibe. Think about the difference between smell, aroma, and stench.

# Paraverbal Communication

---

## Terms
* Tone: the emotion evident in a voice
* Volume: loudness or quietness of a voice
* Pitch: highness or lowness of a voice
* Inflection: the way pitch changes in a sentence or statement
* Cadence: the speed at which words are spoken, and the length of pauses in between words

Note:
Tone is usually an emotion: happy, angry, intense, questioning.

Volume is obvious. We can also make meaning from a *changing* volume (ie, getting louder or quieter as you speak).

Pitch is the same as musical pitch. Note that pitch has nothing to do with volume. 

Inflection is change in pitch. Can often be described as upward, downward, or flat. 

Cadence is often described as fast or slow.

# Nonverbal Communication

---

## Terms
* Posture: the way a body is positioned
* Expression: the emotion evident in the position of a body
* Gesture: body movement that carries generally-understood meaning
* Appearance: information conveyed in the grooming and dressing of a body

Note: 
Posture has its own set of words (usually objective/emotionless): open, closed, powerful, submissive. 
Can also involve objects.

Expression is described with emotion: happy, nervous, scared, joyful, anxious, tired

Gesture is based in social understanding. They are not universal. 
(people in different cultures may not agree on the meaning of a gesture)

Appearance includes clothes, accessories, hairstyles, piercings, tattoos, etc.
