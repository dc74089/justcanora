# Analyzing Speeches

---

## Your Task
We're about to watch a couple speeches. While they're playing, raise your hand if you notice
something noteworthy the speaker is doing. I want to know:

* Using the vocab words we learned yesterday, how would you describe what the speaker is doing?
* What effect does it have? How does it add to the speech?
