# Communication Apprehension

## Communication Apprehension
* Also known as "stage fright" or "speech anxiety"
* Natural response to performing in front of a group
  * High Stakes
  * Unpredictable / Uncontrollable

Note:
* CA is, at its core, a reaction that is based in anxiety
* Public speaking is high-stakes. 
  * People care how they are perceived.
  * You are not in control of how your audience reacts to your message.
* This can produce a "fight or flight" response

# Overcoming CA

## Before Your Speech
* Preparation
* Visualization
* Positive Self-Talk

Note:
Preparation: It goes without saying, but the more prepared you are, the more confident you will feel.

Visualization: Visualize your speech going well. It's certainly not the most interesting thing to visualize, 
but cutting down on negative visualizations will do you well.

Positive Self-Talk: Brag on yourself. Focus on your strengths. Keep a positive mental attitude, and it will
be easier for you to stay in a positive frame of mind when you are delivering your speech.

## Right Before Your Speech
* Breathing
* Progressive Relaxation

Note:
Controlled breathing can lower levels of stress hormones in your body

Progressive relaxation: first relax your feet, and work one body part at a time toward your
head. It can be hard to relax your whole body at once, but this strategy can make it more manageable

---

## During Your Speech
* Identify your energy
* Focus on your message
* Accept imperfection
* Power posture
* **Do it scared**

Note:
Identify your energy: in fight or flight, your body wants you to *move*. Find how that energy 
is trying to manifest itself, and try to steer it toward something productive.

Focus on your message: don't get lost in the mechanics or trying to "seem" a certain way. Make sure
your main focus is on the message you're trying to deliver. 

Power posture: hold your body in a confident way, and confidence will come.
