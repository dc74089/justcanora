# Why CS

<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="STATICPREFIX/common/1-intro/so-you-want-to-be-a-wizard.png">
</div>

Note:
One of my favorite series as a kid was So You Want to Be a Wizard. In the books, two kids (Kit and Nita)
are inducted as wizards. 

Magic in these books is done by mastery of The Speech. The Speech is a language that the universe speaks.
Everything, from trees to rocks to the air can speak and listen in The Speech. To cast a spell, a wizard
uses The Speech to speak their objective, and suggest a way of making it happen. Magically, it happens. 

I see programming as the same type of wizardry as the kids in these books. Just like wizards are scholars
of The Speech, programmers are scholars of these "magical" languages where, in order to bring something
into existence, all you have to do is speak it.

# Python

---

## What is Python?
Python is a programming language that is:
* High-Level
* General-Purpose
* Imperative

Note:
**High Level**: Programmers are more worried about *algorithms* than *memory management*
**General Purpose**: Can be used for almost any purpose
**Imperative**: Programmers write a list of instructions that are executed one "step" at a time

---

## Python in the Real World
* General Programming
* AI
* Data Science
* Web

Note:
* Python is the 3rd most popular programming language as of a 2024 survey (first is JS, second is HTML/CSS)
* Popular AI libraries include TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch
* Popular Data Science libraries include Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, and MatPlotLib
* Popular Web libraries include Django and Flask

# Our Course

---

## Course Goals
Confident Understanding of:
* Python Syntax
* Basic Data Structures
* Basic Algorithms
* Computing & Problem-Solving

---

## How Do We Get There?
* Problems before Content
* Live Coding
* Code Reviews
* **Trust**

Note:
I ask for your trust because at times, I will put you into situations where you feel "shaky".
This is because problem-solving is one of the most important parts of programming. 

In math, every quadratic equation is solved using the same steps. In programming, every solution is
more or less unique. I will give you tools and teach you how to use them, but it will be your job to
figure out how to use those tools to accomplish a given task.
