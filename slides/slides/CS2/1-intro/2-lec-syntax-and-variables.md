# Python Syntax

----

## What is Syntax?
Syntax is, at a simple level, the order of words and symbols in a language.

---

## Why is syntax important?
* Syntax carries meaning! Note the differences between these two sentences:

> The ball the kicked! girl

> The girl kicked the ball!

* Computers are cruel and unforgiving. Your syntax must be nearly-perfect, or else the computer will become very confused and throw an error.

Note:
Only one of these sentences makes sense. If you put words in a different order, you change (or lose)
the meaning of a sentence. 

When we're programming, if you use the wrong syntax, you will get an error.

The best way to learn syntax is by **reading and writing code** and **making meaning from error messages**

# Your First Program
> A "Hello, World!" program is generally a simple computer program which outputs to the screen a message similar to "Hello, World!" while ignoring any user input. A small piece of code in most general-purpose programming languages, this program is used to illustrate a language's basic syntax. -Wikipedia

## Hello World
Let's create a "Hello World" program together! 

1. Open PyCharm
2. Start a New Project
3. Type the following code:
```python
print("Hello World!")
```
4. Run your code using the "play" button (make sure "current file" is selected!)
