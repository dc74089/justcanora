# HTML Hello World

> A "Hello, World!" program is generally a simple computer program which outputs to the screen a message similar to "Hello, World!" while ignoring any user input. A small piece of code in most general-purpose programming languages, this program is used to illustrate a language's basic syntax. -Wikipedia

Your task for this assignment is to create a "Hello, World!" webpage, which doesn't do anything other than display the text "Hello, World!". Once you have the text showing on the screen (and no errors in your IDE), feel free to "dress up" the page if you would like. 

Remember, the most basic HTML page contains an `<html>` tag, which contains a `<body>` tag, which contains some text.
